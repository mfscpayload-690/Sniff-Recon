# 🤖 AI Setup Guide for Sniff Recon GUI

This guide will help you set up the AI-powered packet analysis features in Sniff Recon's GUI interface.

## 🔑 Getting AI API Keys (Optional)

### Groq API (Free Tier Available)
1. **Visit Groq**: Go to [https://console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys)
2. **Create Account**: Sign up for a free account if you don't have one.
3. **Generate API Key**:
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Give it a name (e.g., "Sniff Recon AI")
   - Copy the generated key.

### OpenAI API (Paid)
1. **Visit OpenAI**: Go to [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. **Create Account**: Sign up and add payment method
3. **Generate API Key**: Create a new secret key

## 📁 Environment Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Create .env File** (for AI features):
   ```env
   # Optional AI Providers
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

### Launch the GUI
```bash
streamlit run sniff_recon_gui.py
```

The application will open at `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.

## 💡 Example AI Queries

- "What are the top 5 source IP addresses?"
- "Are there any suspicious patterns in this traffic?"
- "What protocols are being used most frequently?"
- "Show me the most common destination ports"
- "Is there any evidence of port scanning?"
- "Summarize the overall network activity"
- "Are there any potential security threats?"

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### GUI Loading Issues
- Ensure Streamlit is installed: `pip install streamlit`
- Check if port 8501 is available
- Try running with a specific port: `streamlit run sniff_recon_gui.py --server.port 8502`

### File Upload Issues
- Supports `.pcap`, `.pcapng`, `.csv`, and `.txt` files
- File size limit is 200MB
- Make sure your packet capture files are valid

### AI Analysis Issues
- Verify your `.env` file contains valid API keys
- Check your internet connection
- AI features are optional - the app works without them

## 📊 Features
