- `setup_api_key.py` - CLI setup script
- `setup_multi_agent.py` - Multi-agent setup script
- `test_ai_function.py` - Testing scripts
- `test_hf_api.py` - API testing scripts

## What You Get Instead

‚úÖ **Modern Web-Based GUI** - Beautiful, responsive interface  
‚úÖ **Drag & Drop File Upload** - Easy file handling  
‚úÖ **Interactive Analysis** - Real-time charts and tables  
‚úÖ **AI-Powered Insights** - Natural language queries (optional)  
‚úÖ **Export Capabilities** - Download results as JSON  
‚úÖ **Beautiful Dark Theme** - Modern cyberpunk design  

## How to Use the New Version

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies

## Need the CLI Version?

If you specifically need CLI functionality, you can:
1. Use the previous version of this repository (check git history)
2. Use standard networking tools like `tshark`, `tcpdump`, or `wireshark`
3. Build your own CLI wrapper around the existing parser modules
